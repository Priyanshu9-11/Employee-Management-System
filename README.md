 I built a **Employee Management System** using the power of C programming! ðŸŽ‰
 
 **Key Features**:
- **Structured Data Management**: Utilized C **structures** to represent employee information like name, ID, salary, designation, experience, and age.
- **Macros for Efficiency**: Used **macros** to define constants like the maximum number of employees, keeping the code dynamic and scalable.
- **Arrays** for Record Storage: Stored employee records efficiently using arrays for fast access and management.

ðŸ’¡ **Core Functionalities**:
1. Build an employee table with details.
2. Insert new employee records.
3. Search for employees by ID.
4. Delete employee records.
5. Display employee information in a user-friendly format.
